## Early JS Design Goals

"HTML needed a language that was **easy to use**, written directly **in the Web page markup**. We aimed to provide a **"glue language"** for the Web designers and part time programmers who were building Web content from components such as images, plugins, and Java applets. We saw Java as the "component language", where the glue programmers -- the Web page designers -- would assemble components and automate their interactions using JS." - Brendan Eich

Note:
- Designed to be forgiving
- Tries to keep running
- ~1000 lines of code

# What is TypeScript?

> "A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript" - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

> "JavaScript that scales" - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

---

# Why TypeScript?

- Remember the design goals? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- <span class="fragment">The Web is <del>Major</del>.Minor.Patch</span>

Note:
- TypeScript smoothes over some rough edges
- Additive only
  - Foot guns will always be there

# 👍 & 👎

<small>(Pros & Cons)</small>

---

## 👍

- Gradual typing <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Works with many popular libraries! <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> [definitelytyped.org](http://definitelytyped.org) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Developer tooling 😍 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- Gradual typing
  - Allows you to gradually add types to your code. Don't need to rewrite your projects
  - Lets you add types where they're needed
- If a library has typings, TypeScript can work with it.
- As you'll see in a moment, dev tooling is 👍

---

## 👎

- Gradual typing 🤔 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Doesn't work with many popular libraries! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
- Gradual typing
  - Not strict, effectiveness is on the developer.
- Not all libraries and frameworks are supported. They need to be kept up to date.
